<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The publishers cannot permit this modest harbinger of their
great enterprise to steal into the world without stating how
thoroughly they believe in the excellence of their I<span
class="smcap">NSIDECOMPLETUAR</span>, and how intense an emotion of
gratitude fills their bosoms towards every one who has helped them
in their stupendous production. To editors, advertising agents,
compositors, and office-boys alike their hearts go forth in a flood of
unctuous and oleaginous fellowship.</p>

<p>It is impossible for the publishers to over-estimate the pleasure
which they felt on learning that Messrs. Derry and Toms were willing to
join the editorial staff.</p>

<p>The news that came a few minutes later to the effect that Mr.
Daniel Leno would also put his services at their disposal moved them
to transports of gratification; only excelled by the fainting fit of
rapture into which they subsided on ascertaining that Messrs. Salmon
and Gluckstein’s reluctance to act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg
6]</span> had been at length overcome by the tactful intercession of
Bishop Welldon.</p>

<p>They cannot refrain from pointing out with pardonable pride that
their columns contain no fewer than forty million words of text, and
that if the entire staff of contributors were placed in a horizontal
position, the feet of one touching the head of another, they would
extend in unbroken continuity from</p>

<p class="caps">DENMARK HILL TO DELHI.</p>

<p>Again, if the collective brain avoirdupois of these gifted creatures
were placed in the scale it would cause</p>

<p class="caps">1600 WHITE ELEPHANTS</p>

<p class="noindent">to kick the beam with fatal violence.</p>

<p>Having, in duty to ourselves and our contributors, stated these simple
but convincing facts, we have only to lift the curtain and invite
our myriad subscribers to fall to upon the eupeptic and unparalleled
banquet which it has been our privilege to provide.</p>

<h2 id="Casket_of_Jewels">To Intending Purchasers of
our Casket of Jewels.</h2>

<p>The instalment system as applied to this stupendous work has been so
carefully arranged, as to bring the volumes</p>

<p class="caps">WITHIN REACH OF THE HUMBLEST,</p>

<p class="noindent">if anybody after reading our Preface is humble any
longer.</p>

<p>To those who are so eccentric as to prefer to pay for the
I<span class="smcap">NSIDECOMPLETUAR</span> in the lump,</p>

<p class="caps">THE PRICE IS A COOL ‘THOU.’</p>

<p class="noindent">For others, we have a graduated scale drawn up by
the</p>

<p class="caps">BEST ACTUARY</p>

<p class="noindent">that money could procure. Thus, we can take monthly
payments as low as a shilling, or goods to that value, excepting
perishable articles such as eggs, fish, fruit, and army boots, but
the books will naturally be a little more expensive in the long run.
This, however, is unimportant and negligible, as in the majority of
cases it will be one’s heirs who will have to complete the purchase.
For example, let us suppose that the purchaser is about to be
twenty-one—and there is no better way in which to</p>

<p class="caps">ATTAIN ONE’S MAJORITY</p>

<p class="noindent">than in the company of our invaluable I<span
class="smcap">NSIDECOMPLETUAR</span>—the subjoined table will show at
what age his monthly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
payments at a shilling will cease, also at eighteenpence and two
shillings. Simple division will enable the hesitating purchaser to
compute the time required for higher rates of instalment.</p>

<p>But what the purchasers on the hire system cannot</p>

<p class="caps">TOO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND,</p>

<p class="noindent">is that although the instalments go on, the volumes
are</p>

<p class="caps">DELIVERED AT ONCE.</p>

<p class="noindent">On the morning after the first shilling instalment
is received they will</p>

<p class="caps">COME WITH THE MILK.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nothing can stop them. Your pavement will be
blocked by them within twenty-four hours of posting your remittance,
unless, of course, the coal-shoot is open. Understand this clearly,
we</p>

<p class="caps">CANNOT TAKE THEM BACK.</p>

<p class="noindent">Once we have got a set off our hands, threats,
persuasion, tears, and entreaties are alike powerless to induce us to
receive it again.</p>

Iron Buildings.</p>

<p class="caps">ONE HOUSE ONE CYCLO</p>

strain. Hence Mr. Humphry Ward’s noble project.</p>

<p>These buildings are easily erected, and for housing the I<span

old method of shooting them into the coal-cellar, where the process of

aridity of which the country was so sorely in need was all secreted

of their masterly treatment by Lady Jeune in another place [see <i>The

It is enough to state here that the women were splendid, especially

<p><span class="titlebold">America.—</span>... The Fauna of America is
extensive and peculiar. Unlike other civilised countries, dangerous
wild beasts and birds of prey are commonly encountered in the most
populous districts. Nothing can exceed the ferocity of the Trust
Fowl, while whole regions of New York are rendered unsafe by the
ravages of the Tammany Bos and the Tammany Tiger. Yet alongside these
examples of barbarous atavism, one encounters evidences of singular
refinement and humanity. Mr. Roosevelt, though originally a cowboy,
has set his face like a flint against the tyranny of the Beef Trust,
and only a superficial observer would count Mr. Hay as a man of straw.
Furthermore, the humanising influence of American culture is signally
displayed by its principal exports, which include, amongst other
products, J. Pierpont Morgan, canned peaches, Mr. Duke, duchesses, R.
G. Knowles, coon songs, Quaker oats, Tabs, Christian Science, Virginia
hams, cocktails, Major Pond, Honeysuckles, Bees, and Edna May....</p>

<p>In the matter of liquid refreshment America has always set a high
standard of excellence. As George Washington<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> aptly observed, ‘I care not who makes
the laws of this nation so long as their drinks are discreetly
mixed.’...</p>

<p>But the supreme boon conferred on the western world by this great
Republic has yet to be revealed. All that is best in the present
great Thesaurus of Universal Knowledge, the <i>Insidecompletuar
Britanniaware</i>; all the electrifying ragtime methods of our scheme
of advertisement; all the ‘sideshows’ in this superb and brainy
bazaar; are the product of the volcanic and voluptuous Transatlantic
imagination....</p>

<p><span class="titlebold">Automobilism.—</span>... No self-respecting
editor should possess fewer than six motor-cars, if he has any
consideration for the well-being of his staff. Personally I have
fifteen—called after my brothers—with a set of costumes and a perfume
to match each. <i>Peau de Suède</i> and Parma violets go best with a
Panhard; <i>Crêpe de Chine</i> and Patchouli with<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> a Napier; Accordion-pleated nun’s veiling
and Sanitas with a Daimler; crocodile skin and Lavender Water with
a Serpollet. Great care should also be taken in the choice of a
<i>chauffeur</i>. Thus for my new 75 h.p. ‘Mors’ omnibus I have been
careful to secure a driver with a veritable death’s head. Much depends
also on the timbre and pitch of the horn, and the employment of a short
musical phrase or <i>motif</i> as a danger signal to unwary pedestrians
has been found to exercise a singularly seductive influence. I may
note in conclusion that the exhilaration produced by a quick run is
most stimulating to the imagination of the intelligent journalist. In
fact it may be laid down as a canon, that the faster one travels the
more explosively one writes, and good journalism should be a series of
explosions. Automobility is incompatible with senility, and I attribute
the perennial youth of my staff to the constant inhalation of the
antiseptic fumes of my mechanical stud. Those whom the ‘gods’ applaud
must stay or die young....</p>

<p><span class="titlebold">Ballad Concerts.—</span>... A long and
arduous experience of this class of entertainment has convinced me
of the immense difficulty of prolonging the life of children beyond
the second verse of a sentimental ballad. Once the chords in the
accompaniment are grouped in threes nothing can save them from the
celestial regions. Here we may note the great superiority of Music
over the other arts. Literature gives us the grand conception of
the Heavenly Twins, but Music presents us with the still grander
achievement of the Angelic Triplets....</p>

<p><span class="titlebold">Bookmaking.—</span>... Towards the close of
the Nineteenth Century the literary output was enormously increased
by the intervention of labour-saving machinery. Had the phonograph
and the type-writer been available in the Elizabethan era I feel
convinced that Bacon would have written not only Shakespeare, but the
entire literature of the civilised world. A full-sized, full-blooded
novel can now be produced in ten days, for although the employment
of band-working machines to some extent weakens each section, this
weakening can be partially neutralised by careful headbanding.
Furthermore, undue and laborious insistence on niceties of expression
is largely obviated by the greater rapidity of production now
attainable. Style is no longer a fetish, and breaches of grammar or
syntax no longer constitute an obstacle in the way of generous public
recognition....</p>

to save the game is certain. Whether we should restrict all first-class
cricketers to a plasmon diet, or use a thorough base-ball charged with
lyddite is a moot question. Some authorities—including Abel—suggest the
substitution of a regulation ’All Caine for the present bat, whilst
others are for adding six stumps, six inches apart, and doubling the
number of fieldsmen. It has also been suggested that, as the spectator
is after all the principal person to be considered, every visitor to
the ground should receive a revolver at the turnstile, to be emptied
upon the players at his discretion. The apparent folly of employing
flannel for the costume of the players seemed to call for legislation
on the part of the M.C.C. But the discovery—during a recent inspection
of the Jaeger Rifle Club—that flannel is the basic material of hygienic
pastime-wear has induced us to modify our hostile verdict. The phrase
‘muddied oafs’ as applied to footballers still stands....</p>

<p><span class="titlebold">Gardening.—</span>The first requisite of the
modern gardener is books. It is necessary to have too many, and as they
are published at the rate of three a week, one can easily accomplish
this. In buying seeds remember that Buttons’ are the best,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> and we shall take it kindly
if you mention our name when you send your orders. Primroses are best
grown from roots. This was the favourite flower of Napoleon at St.
Helena. A serviceable evening dress can be made by collecting old
lamp shades, stripping them from their wire frames, and joining the
pieces. Remember also that in default of regulation celluloid balls for
ping-pong, unripe tomatoes form an excellent substitute. The first and
last word in successful gardening is the preparation of the soil. No
soil is too rich for the dandelion. If your creepers are too rampant
remember that they can be checked by the use of Keating, in ordering
which please mention this work. An excellent substitute for champagne
is obtained by mixing gooseberry juice and sugar with the cheapest form
of aerated water, and bottling it in old champagne bottles, which can
be obtained from the nearest golf club. A watering-pot is a <i>sine quâ
non</i> in good gardening, also a dictionary of quotations and some
ridiculous neighbours. With this equipment the modern gardener, in
the space of six months or so, ought to be able to fulfil the main
object of his calling, and compile a book which will appeal to persons
utterly unable to distinguish a pansy from a cauliflower.</p>

much that the horse is an animal with a leg at each corner, but that
these legs should be at least as strong as those fitted to a<span

Just as there is a use for everything, even Shoolbred’s, so there is a
use for a horse with three legs. I do not say the army can do without
such an animal. But he has no proper place in a cavalry regiment; his
place is among the beef stores. This confusion of duties, this exchange
of interests between the Remount and the Commissariat Department,
was one of the blots on the recent South African war. Shipload after
shipload of horses arrived in Table Bay (I take pleasure in writing the
name of a geographical feature so admirably chosen) all excellently
adapted for the purpose of the cuisine, but all destined by official
perversity for the capture of De Wet. It is such methods that we must
avoid in the future, and it is for this purpose that I have imported a
sterling line of cane-bottomed mustangs from the Austrian Bent Woods,
which I am prepared to offer to the War Office at a low rate, subject
to discount for cash, if Mr. Brodrick has any....</p>

<p><span class="titlebold">Restaurants—</span>... Advancing
civilisation having shown that efficiency is based on fine feeding,
it is the paramount duty of every patriotic Briton to dine not wisely
but too well. As a great gourmet has remarked, a rich <i>menu</i>
spells a happy <i>ménage</i>. At the same time it is advisable to dine
at home as seldom as possible: it is cheap but monotonous, and often
nasty, and there are 150 restaurants in London where a succulent dinner
can be had for anything from 15<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> a head, a
fact of which the British workman seems to be painfully unaware. The
conversation of a <i>chef</i>, or even an intelligent waiter, is, it
should be borne in mind, almost invariably stimulating and refined.
By thus conscientiously evading the dreariness of domesticity, a
self-respecting and well-nourished citizen, reinvigorated by repeated
visits to Monte Carlo, Cannes, Homburg, and occasional week-ends at the
most luxurious hotels on the south coast, may be able to support the
burden of existence with equanimity, and be ready for his country’s
call. Every house should be connected to a good restaurant by a
souptureenean passage....</p>

<p><span class="titlebold">Tomb-building.—</span>... The architecture
of mausoleums, tombs, cenotaphs, and other mortuary monuments has
shown of late years a deterioration in regard to solidity of structure
very painful to me in my cemeterial constitutionals from Kensal
Green to Gravesend. Instead of the Cyclopean ponderosity of the
Pre-Mycenæan epoch, one notices everywhere a flimsiness of material
and meretriciousness of ornament most distressing to the serious
observer. The trail of the jerry-builder is over all. I rejoice,
however, to note signs of a return to a saner and more solid style of
memorial architecture. Foremost in this movement are the enlightened
and enterprising inventors of Bell’s Encyclopædic Tomb Blocks which in
point of density of texture and specific gravity compare favourably
with any other materials, whether of metal, brick, or stone. Once
placed in position they cannot be removed even by the wildest of
hydraulic rams or the most ferocious of cranes. I can conceive no
more ideal resting-place for a wearied littérateur than a mausoleum
constructed of these stupendous and impressive blocks. Where, indeed,
could a man sleep more profoundly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg

<p><span class="titlebold">Yachting.—</span>... I was born at Youghal.
The first thing I can remember is a discussion between my parents as
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span> what my name should
be. My mother wanted me to be called Guelph; but my father would not
agree. ‘No,’ said my father, ‘he shall be called Thomas, because it
begins with tea.’ I was not an unhappy child, but it was said in the
family that I took out a whine licence very early. My passion for the
water seems to have begun incredibly soon. I am told that before I
could walk or speak I would spend hours propped against the bath racing
the soap-dish against the hair-brush. My favourite reading was the
<i>Tailor and Cutter</i> and the <i>Pilot</i>. At Eton I was of course
a wet bob. But I did not neglect my studies. I had Bacon by heart, and
I won a prize for an essay on the probable route of the exodus of the
Sons of Ham, which I traced to Africa <i>viâ</i> the City Road.</p>

<p>From Eton I proceeded to Cambridge, where I soon became an Elder
Brother of Trinity Hall and a Fellow of Kings. I took kindly to golf,
at which I was famed for my tea-shots, but my real taste all lay in an
aquatic direction, and in my second year I obtained my blue-jacket as

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
